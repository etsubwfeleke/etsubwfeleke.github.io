Followed by Portugal, Spain, Lithuania, Austria, Greece, and Italy. Bulgaria offers the most affordable education overall (low tuition + low cost of living). ‚úÖ Most Expensive Countries: The Netherlands, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and the UK have the highest tuition fees. Ireland, Denmark, and Finland also have high living costs. ‚úÖ Average Tuition: Across the countries analyzed, the average tuition fee is around ¬£4,000. ‚úÖ Cost ‚â† Quality: Affordability doesn‚Äôt always guarantee high education quality. Estonia ranked #1 for education quality and access (Score: 91.86) based on a study using 17 intelligence and development indicators.
